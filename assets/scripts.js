// APP FUNCTIONALITY

/* Have a way to maybe submit different foods and pull data
from the internet that shows calories (maybe macros) and average food costs
pulled from a few different popular grocery chains.

PROCESS

1. Homepage / Dashboard
The homepage serves as the central hub where users get a quick overview of their daily or weekly progress. This page should give a snapshot of key metrics and easy access to core features.

Overview of daily calorie intake (e.g., a bar or pie chart showing consumed calories vs. target)
Exercise summary (calories burned, activity completed today)
Weight progress (simple line graph showing weight over time, optional)

2. Meal Sections
The meal section is where users will enter what they ate in a day (Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, etc.)
to be counted toward the calory intake goal each day, as well as show macros for what was eaten.
Also should show average food cost and take macro/calory information from APIs.

3. History Section

The history section shows past meals and should be connected to the meal section
so if users follow a certain diet they can easily take past meals and enter them
again in the Meal Sections. Among other things

4. Exercise Section
The exercise section is where users will enter their exercise data. What exercises they did,
how long they did them for/how many reps, estimate calories burned, etc.
Ideally will be able to pull all of that data from any smart swatches
or other exercise apps owned by user for maximum convenience.
